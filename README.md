# Can-you-Code
A coding assessment designed as a part of an interview process. 

## Description

I build this multiple choice coding assessment to help employers decide whether a potential employee is qualified enough for the role. It is a 90 second timed quiz with a time penalty for each incorrect answer. Each correct answer earns 10 points. 

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage

To use this, the user can start by clicking the Start Quiz button and will be presented with a question and the timer will start. As the user answers questions, the next question appears. If a user gets the question wrong, time is subtracted from the clock.When the game is over, the user can record their name and score.
The user will be able to view whether they got the questions right or wrong. Their scores will be saved in Local Storage.
